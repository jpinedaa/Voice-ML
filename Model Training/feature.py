"""feature module.

This module provides functions for calculating the main speech
features that the package is aimed to extract as well as the required
elements.


Functions:

    filterbanks: Compute the Mel-filterbanks
                 The filterbanks must be created for extracting
                 speech features such as MFCC.

    mfcc: Extracting Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient feature.

    mfe: Extracting Mel Energy feature.

    lmfe: Extracting Log Mel Energy feature.

    extract_derivative_feature: Extract the first and second derivative
        features. This finction, directly use the ``derivative_extraction``
        function in the ``processing`` module.
